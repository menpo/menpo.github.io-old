Title: The Core Menpo Team!
url: team.html
save_as: team.html

At the moment, Menpo is a student led effort consisting of a team of 4 full
time PhD candidates and 1 lecturer at Imperial College London.
We are all members of the [IBUG](http://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/) team and are
actively investigating the areas of deformable modelling and parametric image
alignment.

Although we are currently a small team, we are enthusiastic about social coding
and we are very keen to receive contributions from anyone who is interested.
If you feel like you want to contribute in any way, please head over to our
[Github page!](http://www.github.com/menpo/menpo)

Patrick is a PhD candidate under the supervision of
[Dr. Stefanos Zafeiriou](#stefanos) investigating the recovery of 3D shape
from 2D images. He is particularly interested in robust shape recovery under
challenging in-the-wild conditions. His current research interests include
Shape-from-Shading, deformable modelling, 3D image alignment and photometric
stereo.
