Title: Windows Installation

In these instructions we aim to make it very simple to install Menpo.
If anything is *at all* unclear, please let us know on the
[menpo-users](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/menpo-users) mailing list.

*If you already have a conda environment, and consider yourself a conda expert,
you may want to view the 
[short instructions]({filename}/pages/installation/windows/expert.md).*

**It is important to note that as part of the installation, you will be creating
an isolated environment to execute Python inside. Make sure that this
environment is activated in order to be able to use Menpo!**

The installation instructions are split up in to a number of sections. Please
follow them carefully, in order:

  1. [Install A Python Environment](#install_miniconda)
  2. [Using Conda](#using_conda)
  3. [Setting Up A Fresh Environment](#conda_env)
  4. [Installing Menpo Into Conda](#install_menpo)
  5. [Begin Using Menpo](#notebooks)

### Install A Python Environment {: #install_miniconda}
First, we need to install a Python environment. The Python environment we will
use is called **conda**, and it is provided by an installation package
called **Miniconda**.

**[Download Miniconda from here](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html)**

Download the **Python 2** copy of Miniconda for your architecture of Windows
(32-bit or 64-bit). If you are unsure what version of Windows you are running,
you can find out by visiting
[this page](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/827218).

********************************************************************************

********************************************************************************

After downloading Miniconda, run the installer and click `Next >` on each
screen that is presented. It is particularly important that both checkboxes are
ticked on the **Advanced Installation Options** page as shown below:

********************************************************************************

### Using Conda {: #using_conda}
After installing Miniconda, we should have access to two new commands within
the command prompt. Python, unlike Matlab, does not come with an integrated
development environment and so commands have to be run using the command prompt.
To continue, we need to open a command prompt, which can be found by selecting
**Start** and typing ``command prompt``

********************************************************************************

********************************************************************************

### Setting Up A Fresh Environment {: #conda_env}
We now need to create an environment to store all of our Python packages inside.
It doesn't matter what path you are inside within the command prompt, the
`conda` command will not create any files *locally*. So, we use the command

    ::console
    C:\>conda create -n menpo python

********************************************************************************
![Create New Environment Command]({filename}/pages/installation/windows/images/Windows-Create-Env-Command.png)
********************************************************************************

This will inform you that you are creating a new environment and installing
Python inside of it. The environment name is given by `-n menpo` (the
environment will be called `menpo`) and only `python` will be installed inside
by default.

To ensure you want to continue, Conda will prompt you
about if you wish to proceed. Press **Enter** to continue. Conda will create
a new environment for you and give you some information about activating
your new environment called `menpo`.

********************************************************************************
![Environment Created]({filename}/pages/installation/windows/images/Windows-Env-Created.png)
********************************************************************************

Now, activate the `menpo` environment with the command:

    ::console
    C:\>activate menpo

********************************************************************************
![Activate Menpo Environment]({filename}/pages/installation/windows/images/Windows-Activate-Env.png)
********************************************************************************

Notice that the command prompt is new prefixed with a label:

    ::console
    [menpo] C:\>

This let's you know that the `menpo` environment is enabled. It is important
to ensure that the `menpo` environment is activated before attempting to
use Menpo in any way!

### Installing Menpo Into Conda {: #install_menpo}
Installing Menpo only requires a single command:

    ::console
    [menpo] C:\>conda install -c menpo menpo

Conda will then attempt to install all of our requirements. It appears there are
many, but this is due to the minimal nature of the environment we originally
created. As before, Conda will prompt you to proceed, press **Enter** to
continue.

********************************************************************************
![Accept Install]({filename}/pages/installation/windows/images/Windows-Install-Accept.png)
********************************************************************************

It may take a short time to download and install all of Menpo's dependencies,
during which you will see a number of progress bars. The command is complete
when the extracting and linking processes show **COMPLETE**.

********************************************************************************

********************************************************************************

**Congratulations! You have now installed the latest version of Menpo!**

### Begin Using Menpo {: #notebooks}
In order to start using Menpo, we suggest you have a look through our collection
of IPython notebooks. They can be found [here]({filename}/pages/notebooks.md).
Follow the instructions there to download the notebooks and run them. If you
need more help you can consult the
[documentation](http://menpo.readthedocs.org) or ask for help on the
[menpo-users](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/menpo-users) mailing list.
